            <p>A long time ago, there lived a happy family. The family had four members – one father, one mother, and two sisters. The two sisters were like best friends. However, both of them had a few different traits. While Bella, the eldest sister, was an energetic and outspoken girl, Betty, the younger sister, was a calm one who used to spend most of her time with her mother. Bella loved stray animals and would feed them whenever get a chance, but Betty, on the other hand, used to get scared of dogs and never liked them.  
            One fine day, when Bella was playing outside her house, she saw a little dog on the road. It was a cute little Labrador, all alone. The dog was shaking in the middle of the road as the owner had left him alone. Bella sensed his pain, “Ohh dear! What a cute and sad dog. I must help him.” She picked the dog up and brought it to her home. 
            Bella called out to her parents, “Mom, Dad, please look what I brought.” Betty did not like dogs, and when she saw that dog in the house, she started shouting at her sister. After hearing the voices, the mother rushed towards the girls and said, “Sweetheart, why did you bring this dog into the house?” Bella replied, “Mamma, the dog was alone on the road, shaking. The owner must have left him there willingly. I couldn’t see him all sad, so I brought him home with me.” The mother listened carefully. Bella continued, “Can he stay with us?” The mother smiled and agreed.</p>
            <p>Bella and Betty are two sisters who live with their parents. One fine day, Bella saw a dog in the middle of the road, all alone. It was a cute little Labrador. After seeing him alone and sad, Bella pitied the dog and bought him home. Betty, the younger sister, was scared of dogs. She did not like the idea of a dog in the house. The mother tied the dog as Betty was afraid of him. </p>
            <h>moral</h>
            <p>The moral of the story is that one should always be kind and emphatic towards others. Compassion and kind-hearted behaviour always bring out the best in people. As we can see in the story, Betty was earlier scared of dogs because she never interacted with them and thought they would hurt her. But once she gave Sophia, the dog, a chance, she realised they were not vicious. They also want love and care. </p>  
            <p>The second moral of the story is that we should be kind to animals. We should never hurt or provide them with any discomfort. Even though animals can’t speak like humans, they experience emotions like people. Hence, they should also be treated with respect, whether pet or stray. Children must learn to be emphatic towards people and animals. They should be kind and polite to whoever they meet. Whether they meet a homeless person or any animal like a squirrel in the park or a stray dog, they must not badmouth or hurt them in any way. You can teach good values to your child by involving them in social care activities like volunteering at animal shelters, nursing homes, or disability shelters. They can also actively care for neighbourhood animals, birds, and trees.Sophia, the Dog is a popular short story easy to read as well as recite. We hope this story with pictures helped foster good value in your munchkin.</p>
            <p>Once upon a time there lived a king who cared for nobody but himself. He had grown rich from the high taxes he had forced his people to pay, while they had become poorer and poorer. He lived in a gorgeous palace, while the poor people who built it for him still lived in thatched huts and tumble-down hovels. The king's table was always heaped with delicious foods, while most of his people had only one plain meal a day, and sometimes not even that. But the heartless king did not care. If he had what he wanted, that was enough for him.One day a hunter came to the palace gate, intending to teach the heartless king a lesson. The hunter brought with him an enormous dog. The king was fond of hunting and this enormous dog fascinated him. So the hunter and the dog were both welcomed into the palace grounds.But the enormous dog was no ordinary dog, and her bark was like the roar of thunder.
            <h>barks</h>
             <p>The first time she opened her big mouth and barked, the awful noise shook the walls of the palace and frightened the king and all his courtiers. If the dog had stopped with one or two barks, the matter might have been forgotten.But again and again her fierce roaring shook the palace and the Earth itself. Before long there was no resting between barks. Nobody in the palace could hear themselves talk. The king was desperate and sent for the hunter.He asked, "Why does your dog make such a deafening noise?""The dog is hungry," said the hunter"Nothing that is easy for you to give," said the hunter. "Your Majesty, there are people in this kingdom who are eating all the food and who are not sharing it with those who do the work in the field to make the food grow. As a result, there are people who are always hungry. This dog feels the hunger of every person in this kingdom who does not have enough food to eat. As long as even one person is hungry, this dog will be hungry and he will keep barking."On hearing the hunter say this, the king was even more frightened than ever. It had never entered his thoughts that he had been doing anything wrong. He had thought that the people of his kingdom were simply supposed to always do exactly what he wanted. It had never occurred to him that a king should think of the happiness of anyone except himself.He was now angry from his head to his feet, inside and outside. Either he would go mad hearing the continuous barking of that enormous dog, or else something would have to be done and that very quickly. So he called his wise advisors together and said: "What shall I do?"The wise ones bowed their heads and walked off to think over the question together. (Leader — You may wish to pause here, and ask the children what the king should do.) But try as hard as they could, the advisors could see only two possible solutions. Either the enormous dog must be killed, or else every hungry person in the kingdom must be fed. No one was willing to kill the dog. So thatmeant there was only one thing left to do. Everybody in the kingdom must somehow be fed. The wise advisors were very clear in their minds about it. They returned to the king and told him plainly what had to be done. They had to shout, of course, because the enormous dog was still barking. The king hesitated no longer.</p>
            <p>"Put all the servants on the palace grounds to work at once!" he commanded. "Go to the storerooms and get all the bags of rice you can find. Pile them high on carts. Take also meat from my cupboards and gather vegetables and fruits from my gardens. Send servants out with these loaded carts into all the towns and villages in my kingdom. Command the servants to find all the people who are hungry. Give them generously of these foods, and keep on giving food until not a single person in the land is hungry."</p>
